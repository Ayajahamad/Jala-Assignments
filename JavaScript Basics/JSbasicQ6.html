    <h3 id="demo">In strict mode, if you try to assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, you'll get a
        'ReferenceError' instead of silently creating a global variable. This is because strict mode requires all
        variables to be declared before they are used.</h3>

        "use strict";

        function foo() {
            x = 10; // need to use "var": var x=10
            console.log(x);
