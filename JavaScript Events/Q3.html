    <p>'console.log()' is a built-in function in JavaScript that writes a message to the console, which is a debugging
        tool that developers can use to inspect and debug their code. Here are some ways console.log() can be used for
        debugging</p>
    <p>
        Logging variable values: You can use console.log() to log the value of a variable or expression to the console,
        which can help you understand how your code is working and identify errors. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Debugging control flow: You can use console.log() to track the flow of execution through your code, especially
        when dealing with loops, conditions, or function calls. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Testing assumptions: You can use console.log() to test your assumptions about how your code works, and verify
        that it's behaving as expected. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Logging errors: You can use console.log() to log error messages or stack traces to the console when your code
        encounters an error, which can help you identify and fix the problem. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        => Overall, console.log() is a powerful tool for debugging JavaScript code, and can help you understand how your
        code works, identify errors, and test assumptions. However, it's important to remove or comment out any
        console.log() statements before deploying your code to production, as they can slow down your code and
        potentially reveal sensitive information to users.

        //Eg for Logging variable values
        let x = 5;
        console.log(x); // logs 5
        console.log(x + 3); // logs 8

        //Eg for Debugging control flow
        function multiply(a, b) {
            console.log('multiply function called');
            return a * b;
        }

        let y = 5;
        if (y > 0) {
            console.log('x is positive');
            let result = multiply(y, 3);
            console.log('result is', result);
        } else {
            console.log('y is negative or zero');
        }
        //Eg for Testing assumptions
        let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
        console.log(fruits.length); // logs 3
        console.log(fruits[0]); // logs 'apple'
        console.log(fruits[2]); // logs 'cherry'
        console.log(fruits[3]); // logs undefined

        //Eg for Logging errors
        try {
            let result = x + y;
            console.log(result);
        } catch (error) {
            console.log('An error occurred:', error);
        }
